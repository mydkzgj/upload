# RNA-FM
This repository contains codes and pre-trained models for **RNA foundation model (RNA-FM)**.
**RNA-FM outperforms all tested single-sequence RNA language models across a variety of structure prediction tasks as well as several function-related tasks.**
You can find more details about **RNA-FM** in our paper, ["Interpretable RNA Foundation Model from Unannotated Data for Highly Accurate RNA Structure and Function Predictions" (Chen et al., 2022).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00300)
